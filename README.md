React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/?source=post_page-----6e8a2396eea1----------------------).
